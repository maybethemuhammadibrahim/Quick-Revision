1. Conic Sections (2D)

A conic section is formed by slicing a cone at different angles.

1.1 Circle

General Equation:


x^2 + y^2 = r^2

Shape Description: A perfect round shape with all points equidistant from the center.

Unique Identification Points:

Coefficients of  and  are equal.

No  term.

1.2 Ellipse

General Equation:


\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, \quad a > b

Shape Description: A stretched circle, elongated along one axis.

Unique Identification Points:

Coefficients of  and  are positive but unequal.

No  term.

 determines the major axis.

1.3 Parabola

General Equations:

Opens Right/Left:



y^2 = 4px

x^2 = 4py

(y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h), \quad (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)

Unique Identification Points:

Only one variable is squared.

If  is squared, the parabola opens up or down.

If  is squared, the parabola opens left or right.

1.4 Hyperbola

General Equations:

Opens Left-Right:



\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1

\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1

\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1

Unique Identification Points:

One squared term is positive, the other is negative.

The transverse axis determines the direction.

2. Quadric Surfaces (3D)

A quadric surface extends conic sections into three dimensions.

2.1 Ellipsoid

General Equation:


\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1

Unique Identification Points:

All squared terms are positive.
