### **Cheat Sheet for Level of Curves (Conic Sections and Quadric Surfaces)**

This cheat sheet covers the formulas of conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola) at the origin and along both axes, as well as quadric surfaces (ellipsoid, hyperboloid, elliptic cone, elliptic paraboloid, hyperbolic paraboloid). It also includes tips to identify conic sections from their equations.

---

## **1. Conic Sections (At Origin and Along Axes)**

### **Circle**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)  
  - \( r \): Radius of the circle.
- **Key Feature:** Both \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) have **equal coefficients**.

---

### **Ellipse**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \)  
  - \( a \): Semi-major axis (along \( x \)-axis if \( a > b \)).  
  - \( b \): Semi-minor axis (along \( y \)-axis if \( b < a \)).  
- **Key Feature:** Both \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) have **positive coefficients**, and \( a \neq b \).

---

### **Parabola**
- **Standard Equations (Origin):**  
  1. \( y^2 = 4ax \) (opens to the right).  
  2. \( y^2 = -4ax \) (opens to the left).  
  3. \( x^2 = 4ay \) (opens upward).  
  4. \( x^2 = -4ay \) (opens downward).  
  - \( a \): Distance from the vertex to the focus.  
- **Key Feature:** Only one variable is squared.

---

### **Hyperbola**
- **Standard Equations (Origin):**  
  1. \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \) (opens horizontally).  
  2. \( \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1 \) (opens vertically).  
  - \( a \): Distance from the center to the vertex.  
  - \( b \): Related to the slope of the asymptotes.  
- **Key Feature:** One squared term is **positive**, and the other is **negative**.

---

## **2. Quadric Surfaces (At Origin and Along Axes)**

### **Ellipsoid**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1 \)  
  - \( a, b, c \): Semi-axes along \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \)-axes.  
- **Key Feature:** All squared terms have **positive coefficients**.

---

### **Hyperboloid (One Sheet)**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1 \)  
  - \( a, b, c \): Semi-axes.  
- **Key Feature:** Two squared terms are **positive**, and one is **negative**.

---

### **Hyperboloid (Two Sheets)**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1 \)  
  - \( a, b, c \): Semi-axes.  
- **Key Feature:** One squared term is **positive**, and two are **negative**.

---

### **Elliptic Cone**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 0 \)  
  - \( a, b, c \): Semi-axes.  
- **Key Feature:** Two squared terms are **positive**, and one is **negative**, with the equation set to **zero**.

---

### **Elliptic Paraboloid**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = z \)  
  - \( a, b \): Scaling factors.  
- **Key Feature:** Two squared terms are **positive**, and one variable is **linear**.

---

### **Hyperbolic Paraboloid**
- **Standard Equation (Origin):**  
  \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = z \)  
  - \( a, b \): Scaling factors.  
- **Key Feature:** One squared term is **positive**, one is **negative**, and one variable is **linear**.

---

## **3. Identifying Conic Sections from Equations**

### **General Second-Degree Equation:**
\( Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 \)

- **Circle:** \( A = C \) and \( B = 0 \).
- **Ellipse:** \( A \) and \( C \) have the **same sign**, and \( A \neq C \).
- **Parabola:** Either \( A = 0 \) or \( C = 0 \) (only one squared term).
- **Hyperbola:** \( A \) and \( C \) have **opposite signs**.

---

### **Key Points for Identification:**
1. **Circle:** Equal coefficients for \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \), no \( xy \) term.
2. **Ellipse:** Coefficients of \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) are both positive but unequal.
3. **Parabola:** Only one squared term (\( x^2 \) or \( y^2 \)).
4. **Hyperbola:** Coefficients of \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) have opposite signs.
