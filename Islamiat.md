God sent Messengers to guide people because humans cannot figure out on their own how to worship God correctly or create fair laws for everyone. God, in His wisdom and mercy, sent Messengers with clear signs and books to help people and remove any excuses they might have. Here’s why:

---

### **1. To Remove Excuses**
God sent Messengers so no one could have any excuses on the Day Of Judgement  
- On Judgment Day, people will say:  
  “Our Lord, why did you not send a messenger to us, so that we might have followed Your signs before we were humiliated and put to disgrace?”  [Q 20:134]  
- God sent Messengers with clear proofs to stop such excuses.

### **2. To Guide People to Goodness**
Messengers show people what is good for them in this life and the next. Messengers act as an ideal role model for the people 
- Even smart people can’t figure out everything on their own. Messengers help organize life in a fair and beneficial way.  
- "There is indeed a good model for you in the Messenger of Allah"[33:21]
- Messengers protect people from harm and guide them to what’s good.

### **3. To Unite People**
Messengers bring people together under one religion and one belief.  
- When people see the clear signs of a Prophet, they unite in faith, which leads to peace and goodness.  
- Without proof, no one would believe someone claiming to be a Prophet. Messengers come with clear evidence so people can trust them.

### **4. God Chooses His  Messengers from mankind**
God picks the best people to be His Messengers.  
- **Quran says**:  
  *"If We had made him an angel, We would have obviously made him a man, and would have caused them the same confusion they are causing now.”"* [Q]  
  
- Messengers are strong, patient, and kind people chosen by God to deliver His message.

### **5. Responsibilities of Holy Prophet**
According to the  Verse there are four responsibilities
of Holy Prophet ﷺ.
- **Quran says**:  
  *"He is the One who raised amidst the unlettered people a messenger from among themselves who recites to them His verses, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and the wisdom, while they were earlier in open error."* [Q]  
  
- Recitation of the revealed Verses.
- To purify the Soul.
- Teaching the Book.
- Teaching of Wisdom.

### **6. Status of Holy Prophet**
##### Expounder Of the Quran:

##### Authorized Divine Law Giver:

##### Justice and absolute Arbitrator:


### **Some basic Qualities Of Prophets**

There is a wide list of Rasool qualities, we are mentioning here just some specific of them:

- Chastity. (Free from Sins)
- Humanness.( not an angle)
- Miracles.
- Wahi.
- God gifted designation of prophecy


### **Finality of Prophethood**

##### *Meaning of Khatm-e-Nubuat: (The Seal Of Prophets)

Concept of Khatm-e-Nubuwat means that no one will be given the designation of "prophecy" after our beloved Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ . He is the last selected Messenger from God and Quran o Sunnah is the last revealed Law. So no new Nabi or Rasool will come until the day of judgment. This concept is known as Khatm-e-Nubuat

- Today, I have perfected your religion for you, and have completed My blessing upon you, and chosen Islam as Dīn (religion and a way of life) for you.
- MuHammed is not a father of any of your men, but he is a messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets.
- And we have sent you as a mercy for the whole worlds.
- There will be no prophet after me.
- Chain of prophethood has been put an end to with my prophethood.


### **Descending of Hazrat ESA علیہ السلام

We discussed the meaning of Khatm-e-Nubuwwat, if we
concerned the meaning there will be no quires regarding
Hazrat Eesa علیہ السلام because he got the title of
“Prophecy” before Hazarat Muhammed ﷺ not after
him

Beside it ,duties of Hazrat Eesa after descending also
impose the concept of seal of phophecy i.e

He will follow the rules of our Shariah

If Allah decided to continue the chain of Prophecy , he
would send the new Prophet rather than the Old One
