Introduction

Imagine waking up one morning, reaching for your phone to check your emails, only to find... nothing. No notifications, no messages, no internet. Now, imagine that this isn't just your Wi-Fi acting up, but a global internet outage. Businesses have now come to a halt, governments are struggling to function, and millions or even billions are left disconnected.

Therefore, in this presentation we will discuss the hypothetical scenario of "what would happen if the internet went out for a day?" 

Starting with the economic implication of this scenario
According to research by Cybersecurity Ventures, just one day of internet downtime could cost the global economy a staggering $43 billion in losses. Keep in mind that this is only an estimation and the figures could be different But what exactly does that mean for different sectors? Let’s take a closer look.

Tech Platforms

One of the hardest-hit sectors would be the tech giants and businesses, like Amazon, Google, Meta and Alibaba etc.These tech conglomerates and many other businesses would face massive revenue losses due to halted transactions. A real-world example of this was in 2021, when a six-hour outage at Facebook (now Meta) resulted in nearly $100 million in lost revenue.

Consumers would also be at risk, as scammers posing as tech support could exploit the outage through phone calls, specifically tricking less tech-savvy users into sharing sensitive information.

Disruption of Government Services

Beyond businesses, governments also heavily rely on the internet for communication, public services, and data management. An outage could create major disruptions, such as:

Delayed Tax Processing – Online tax filings and revenue management would come to a standstill, delaying revenue collection and impacting government budgets.

Social Security and Welfare – Moreover there would be chaos everywhere making it difficult for the governments throughout the world to manage
Payments by the government could be postponed, affecting individuals who depend on timely disbursements. 

Emergency Response Systems – A compromised internet connection could disrupt  
emergency response teams. A real-world example is the CrowdStrike IT outage in July 2024, which affected several police, fire, and 911 systems, affecting public safety.

Impact on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

While large corporations have backup plans, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are far more vulnerable. Many SMEs rely on e-commerce platforms like Shopify or Amazon, and an internet outage could cause:

Operational Challenges – Unlike larger companies, many SMEs lack offline systems, making it difficult for them to generate revenue.

Customer Relations – Without the ability to communicate with customers or process orders, trust and reputation could take a serious hit.
